# Size Rec Model - Python & ModCloth
Use Kaggle ModCloth Fit Data to create size recommendation model


This project was to help get my feet wet in python for a start to finish ML pipeline. I use the data found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/clothing-fit-dataset-for-size-recommendation) to create a model to predict which size would fit best for a user buying a top from ModCloth based on user reviews and measurements.
